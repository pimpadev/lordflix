# Standard Setup

If you've made it this far, it means the hard part is done. What remains to be done is to set up the services that will run the media center and configure them. Let's do it!

## Run the services
```bash
cd lordflix/docker-compose/
sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Setup *-arr* services
 1. [Radarr]()
 2. [Prowlarr]()

## Setup *Jellyfin* server
  - [Jellyfin]()
