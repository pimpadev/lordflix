Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.38.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

The size of this disk is 3.6 TiB (4000728481792 bytes). DOS partition table format cannot be used on drives for volumes larger than 2199023255040 bytes for 512-byte sectors. Use GUID partition table format (GPT).

Created a new DOS (MBR) disklabel with disk identifier 0x370f3a04.


Use command: g 

  It will change the label to GUID
